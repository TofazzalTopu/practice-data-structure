ReentrantLock in Java

1. What is ReentrantLock?
   ReentrantLock is a class in Javaâ€™s java.util.concurrent.locks package that provides an explicit locking mechanism. It
   is an alternative to the synchronized keyword but offers more flexibility and advanced features.

ðŸ”¹ Reentrant means a thread can acquire the same lock multiple times without causing a deadlock.

2. Why Use ReentrantLock Over synchronized?
   Feature synchronized ReentrantLock
   Lock Acquisition Implicit Explicit (lock() & unlock())
   Fairness Option No Yes (new ReentrantLock(true))
   Interruptible Lock No Yes (lockInterruptibly())
   Try Lock with Timeout No Yes (tryLock(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS))
   Condition Variables No Yes (newCondition()).


3. Basic Example

``` import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

class SharedResource {
    private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public void criticalSection() {
        lock.lock(); // Acquire the lock
        try {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is executing");
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        } finally {
            lock.unlock(); // Release the lock
        }
    }
}

public class ReentrantLockExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SharedResource resource = new SharedResource();

        Runnable task = resource::criticalSection;

        Thread t1 = new Thread(task, "Thread-1");
        Thread t2 = new Thread(task, "Thread-2");

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
 Ensures only one thread can enter the criticalSection() at a time.


```

4. Reentrant Behavior
   A thread can acquire the lock multiple times.

```
class ReentrantExample {
    private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
   
   public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReentrantExample obj = new ReentrantExample();
        obj.methodA();
    }
    
    public void methodA() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            System.out.println("methodA() - Holding lock");
            methodB(); // Calls another locked method
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public void methodB() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            System.out.println("methodB() - Lock re-entered");
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
methodA() calls methodB(), and the same thread re-enters the lock.
```
5. Fair vs. Non-Fair Lock
   By default, ReentrantLock is non-fair, meaning threads may not get the lock in the order they requested.
```
ReentrantLock fairLock = new ReentrantLock(true);  // Fair lock
ReentrantLock unfairLock = new ReentrantLock();    // Default: Unfair lock
Fair locks ensure FIFO ordering but have a slight performance cost.
```

6. tryLock() - Avoid Blocking
   Instead of waiting indefinitely, a thread can try acquiring the lock.

```
if (lock.tryLock()) {
    try {
        System.out.println("Lock acquired!");
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
} else {
    System.out.println("Could not acquire lock!");
}
Prevents deadlocks by not waiting indefinitely.
```

7. lockInterruptibly() - Interruptible Locks
   Allows a thread to abort waiting for a lock if itâ€™s interrupted.

```
try {
    lock.lockInterruptibly();
    // Critical section
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    System.out.println("Interrupted while waiting for lock");
} finally {
    lock.unlock();
}
Useful when handling timeouts or task cancellations.
```   

8. Condition Variables - newCondition()
   Unlike synchronized, ReentrantLock allows fine-grained control with multiple conditions.

```
import java.util.concurrent.locks.*;

class ConditionExample {
    private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private final Condition condition = lock.newCondition();
    private boolean isReady = false;

    public void producer() throws InterruptedException {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            isReady = true;
            condition.signal();  // Notify waiting consumer
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public void consumer() throws InterruptedException {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            while (!isReady) {
                condition.await();  // Wait until signal is received
            }
            System.out.println("Consumed!");
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
More flexible than wait() & notify() in synchronized.
```

9. When to Use ReentrantLock?
```
Use ReentrantLock instead of synchronized when: âœ” You need interruptible locks (e.g., lockInterruptibly()).
âœ” You want to avoid indefinite blocking (e.g., tryLock()).
âœ” You need fairness guarantees (e.g., new ReentrantLock(true)).
âœ” You need multiple condition variables (newCondition()).

ðŸš€ For most cases, synchronized is simpler and preferred, but ReentrantLock is useful for complex concurrency scenarios.
